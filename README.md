# UC ULP GMSS & LTE-M SiP DK

This is a high efficiency ULP SIP GMSS, NBIoT & LTE-M nRF91 STO LTS for IOT with minimal BOM, ultra-low Iq and dedicated STO PHY (IP). It operates with an advanced LP PSM paired with an low iDRX interval RRC idle to optimize RX dBm gain using cDRX variations and variable iDRX PDCCH.

With integrated FETs, LNA and FIDOs, it becomes the perfect LPWA GMSS & NBIoT DK. The only external UE needed is an active IPEX U.FE RoHS MHFI antenna (50 ohms) connected to the on-board SWF. It enables remote HWFC TXD via SWO thanks to it's subscriber identity module.
